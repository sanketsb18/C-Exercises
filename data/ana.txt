Computer is a dumb machine with expeditious computational speed. 
It can give quick results to many of the complex scientific calculations but it canâ€™t perform a task on its own.

This set of instructions is contained in a computer program. 
Computer program is basically in binary language i.e. series of 0s and 1s.
